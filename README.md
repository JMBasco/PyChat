# PyChat

A simple chat  client interfacing with OpenAI's completion API.

## TODO
1. Handle detection of `OPEN_API_KEY` availability
2. `max_tokens` can be set as a parameter outside with a default value.
3. Empty input from user. Suggested to use try except
4. `engine` can be set as a parameter with a default of 'text-davinci-003'
5. choices should be checked if we actually have values

## Addtional feature
1. Put code in while loop so you wont have to return the program
